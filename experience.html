        Bits of My Life<br>
        These are just fragments of my journey, but they hold some of the most precious memories I’ve made with my friends. Each moment spent with them reminds me how life is better when shared with people who truly matter. From the laughter echoing through the hills to the quiet conversations about our dreams and challenges, every memory is a treasure I’ll carry with me forever. I’m incredibly grateful for the friendships that have shaped me into who I am today, and I can only hope for the best for all of them. May their paths be filled with happiness, success, and the same kind of love and warmth they’ve brought into my life. Here’s to more adventures and the friendships that stand the test of time!

    <i>The Night We Met by Lord Huron</i>
</p>
<p>
    "The Night We Met" can remind us of those special moments with friends when everything felt so genuine and carefree. It's like a time when we shared laughter, deep conversations, and unforgettable memories, creating bonds that feel timeless. The song brings back those feelings of closeness and nostalgia, just like when we were all together, enjoying each other's company without a worry in the world.

    After my internship, my friends and I went hiking at Bukit Desa Damai. They were actually old friends of mine, but we reconnected during our internship. Spending time with them again felt like finding a missing piece of my life. The hike was filled with laughter, breathtaking views, and moments of reflection. As we climbed higher, we talked about our dreams, our struggles, and how far we had come. Reuniting with them reminded me how much better life can be with the right people by your side. That day wasn’t just about reaching the top of the hill—it was about cherishing the bond we shared and realizing that some friendships are meant to stand the test of time.

        My 2-month internship was an incredibly rewarding and transformative experience. During this time, I had the opportunity to immerse myself in a professional environment, where I was able to apply what I had learned in the classroom to real-world situations. I worked alongside a talented and supportive team that not only guided me through challenges but also encouraged me to think critically and creatively. Every day presented new opportunities for growth, and I gained valuable hands-on experience in my field that I know will be crucial for my future career.

        The internship also allowed me to develop essential skills such as communication, problem-solving, and teamwork, which helped me become more confident in my abilities. What made this internship truly special, however, was the bond I formed with my colleagues. They were more than just mentors—they became friends, offering advice and sharing their own experiences. The supportive environment made it easy to learn, take risks, and grow as a professional. Looking back, I’m incredibly grateful for the chance to be part of such an inspiring team, and I’m excited to carry everything I’ve learned into the next phase of my career.
